### Going to be an app the runs on cron to pull a real time list of sales orders and manually calc OTHP. WIll also include routes for projecting sales via open sales orders.

### TODO. Need to manually calc the OTHP (will need a sub table if want the detail as there will be more lines in OTHPO than on the invoice.)

- For now I am not calculating the OTJHP at all.
